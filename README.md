# Synapse-AI-Blood-Pressure-Monitor
Synapse’s third feature is an intelligent heart rate monitor which integrates sensors with the capability to monitor the blood pressure along with force sensors. This feature is uniquely important because it will be one of the first applications that can be used by patients to remotely monitor their heart rate, preventing cardiac arrests, blood clots and heart failure.   Our unique AI algorithms and app have been designed to extend the oscillometric principle, which is used by most automated cuff devices to measure blood pressure, to a cuff-less, accessible BP monitoring feature within our app. This feature will allow for patients to observe their heart rate and assess their blood pressure.  Our feature operates on the basis of our user pressing their finger against the Smartphone embedded camera sensor &amp; inertial sensor (force sensor); this is an effective approach because the external pressure of the underlying artery (transverse palmar arch artery) increases as the phone measures the applied pressure, resulting in accurate measurements of the variable-amplitude blood volume oscillations that constitute blood pressure measurements. The phone camera, embedded with photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensors and force transducers, serves as the sensor to measure the blood volume oscillations and applied pressure. From there, Synapse’s Blood Pressure monitoring system computes systolic and diastolic BP from the measurements and provides visual feedback to guide the patients in understanding their results.
